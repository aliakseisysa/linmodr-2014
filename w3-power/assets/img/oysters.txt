"Minchinton & Ross (1999) investigated the distribution of oyster substrates for limpets in four zones alone the shore (the landward zone high on the shore, the mid zone with mangrove trees, the seaward zone with mangrove trees and the seaward zone without trees) by measuring the number of limpets per oyster shell (expressed as the number of limpets per 100 oysters) in five quadrats per zone. Data were collected from two sites (considered a random factor) so as to provide some estimates of the spatial generality of the observed trends (from Box 9.4 of Quinn & Keough (2002))."
